Hello! This is a wordCounter.
It counts all words in a text depending on the threshold you use.
For example with a threshold of 10, it will display all words that occurs more than 10 times in a text.
This is practical when writing thesis etc and need to check if you are using some particular words a bit too much.
Also, it includes total number of words and approxiamte pages.
